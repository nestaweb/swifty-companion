# swifty_companion

## Description
Swifty Companion is a 42 project that aims to create an application that retrieves user information from the 42 API and displays it in a user-friendly way. The application allows users to search for a 42 student by their username and view their information, including their profile picture, login, full name, email, phone number, and level. The application also displays the user's skills, including the skill name and level, as well as the user's projects, including the project name, status, and grade.

## Technologies
I decided to use Flutter for this project because it is a powerful framework that allows to create apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter is also easy to learn for developers who are already familiar with object-oriented programming languages like C++. This is my first project using Flutter and I was very surprised by how intuitive to use it is. I think that comes from the fact that I usually work with React and other web technologies, so I am already familiar with the concepts of components and states. I also used the 42 intra API to retrieve the user information.

## Features
- Search for a 42 student by their username
- Custom Profile page depending on the coalition of the student. 
- Display the user's information, including their profile picture, login, full name, email, phone number, and level
- Display the user's skills, including the skill name and level
- Display the user's projects, including the project name, status, and grade
- Display the user's achievements, including the achievement name and description

## Improvements
- Cache the user information to avoid making multiple requests to the 42 API
- Auto requests to the 42 API to search for the user information when the user types in the search bar
- Better management of api requests to reduce the time it takes to retrieve the user information
- Add more information to the user's profile, such as the user's wallet and correction points
